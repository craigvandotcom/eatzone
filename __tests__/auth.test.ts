/**
 * Authentication Tests
 *
 * Tests for user authentication flows including:
 * - User registration with email/password validation
 * - User login with correct/incorrect credentials
 * - Session persistence across browser refreshes
 * - Auto-logout on session expiration
 * - Demo mode functionality in development/preview environments
 */

// TODO: These tests need to be implemented after proper Supabase auth integration
// Currently the app uses local auth which will be replaced with Supabase auth
// When implementing:
// 1. Test user registration flow with real Supabase
// 2. Test login/logout with session management
// 3. Test password validation and error handling
// 4. Test session persistence and expiration
// 5. Test demo mode functionality

describe("Authentication", () => {
  it("should be implemented after Supabase auth integration", () => {
    // This is a placeholder test that passes
    // Real auth tests will be added when auth system is fully integrated
    expect(true).toBe(true);
