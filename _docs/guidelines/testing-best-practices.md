Alright—let’s turn you into a testing powerhouse for TypeScript and React.
I’ll walk you from absolute basics to expert habits, in clear, bite-sized steps you could listen to on a commute. We’ll cover kinds of tests, how to design code that’s easy to test, the tools you’ll use, workflows that scale, and the “gotchas” pros watch for.

---

## 0) The mindset in one minute

- **Your job isn’t to write tests. Your job is to ship confidence.**
- **Small surface, high signal.** Test what matters to users and contracts between components, not private implementation details.
- **Prefer behavior over wiring.** If a refactor breaks tests but the app still works, your tests were coupled to internals.
- **Types + tests + tooling** all work together: TypeScript prevents whole classes of bugs _before_ runtime, tests prove behavior _at_ runtime, and tools enforce discipline _all the time_.

---

## 1) The map: what to test, from fast to full-stack

Think of three layers you’ll use daily, plus a few specialty layers:

1. **Unit tests** – fastest feedback. Pure functions, custom hooks logic, small utilities.
2. **Component tests** – render a component and interact with it the way a user would.
3. **Integration and E2E tests** – multiple pieces working together, often with the browser.
4. **Contract tests** – front-end and back-end agree on the shape and semantics of data.
5. **Non-functional tests** – accessibility, visual, performance, and security checks.
6. **Type tests** – compile-time assertions that your generics and overloads behave.

As you grow, you’ll aim for a **“testing trophy”** shape: most value from component and integration tests, with a support layer of a few high-value E2E tests and a healthy base of units.

---

## 2) Your toolbelt (choose these and you’re modern)

- **Runner:** Vitest or Jest. If you’re on Vite, pick **Vitest**; otherwise **Jest** is fine.
- **DOM testing:** **@testing-library/react** plus **@testing-library/user-event**.
- **E2E and component-in-browser:** **Playwright** (or Cypress if your team already uses it).
- **Mocking network:** **MSW – Mock Service Worker**. Clean, realistic API tests without brittle stubs.
- **Type assertions:** `expectTypeOf` from Vitest or `tsd`, plus `// @ts-expect-error` where appropriate.
- **Coverage & quality:** Istanbul (built into Vitest/Jest), **Stryker** for mutation testing.
- **Accessibility:** **jest-axe** for unit/component; **axe-core** with Playwright for E2E.
- **Visual regression:** Playwright screenshots, or Chromatic if you use Storybook.
- **Contracts:** Pact for consumer–provider contracts, or **zod**/**OpenAPI** schemas shared by both sides.

---

## 3) Design for testability (this is where experts are made)

- **Separate “logic” from “IO.”** Put data shaping, calculations, and decision logic in plain functions or custom hooks. Keep network and DOM effects at the edges.
- **Dependency injection by parameter, not by reach.** Pass collaborators in (like a fetcher) instead of importing a global.
- **Make side effects swappable.** Wrap `fetch` or storage in tiny adapter modules.
- **Prefer composition to inheritance.** Smaller pieces compose into testable wholes.
- **Deterministic time and randomness.** Centralize `Date.now()`, timers, and random numbers so tests can fix them.
- **Stable selectors.** In UI, query by **accessible role, name, and label**—not by class names.

---

## 4) Unit testing, the right way

**What belongs here:** pure functions, data mappers, small utilities, reducers, and the logic inside custom hooks.

**Golden pattern:** Arrange–Act–Assert.

```ts
// vitest + typescript example
import { expect, test } from "vitest";
import { net } from "./pricing";

test("net() applies tax and discount", () => {
  const price = net({ base: 100, taxRate: 0.2, discount: 0.1 });
  expect(price).toBe(108); // 100 * 1.2 * 0.9
});
```

**Async tip:** prefer `await` over callbacks; fake timers only when time is the feature you’re testing.

**Type tests:** these never run—your compiler enforces them.

```ts
import { expectTypeOf } from "vitest";
import { parseUser } from "./parseUser";

expectTypeOf(parseUser({ id: "1", name: "A" })).toEqualTypeOf<{
  id: number;
  name: string;
}>();
// @ts-expect-error – id must be a string here, so this should fail to compile
parseUser({ id: 1, name: "A" });
```

---

## 5) Component tests that mirror how users interact

**Principle:** If a user can’t do it, your test shouldn’t either. Use roles, labels, and text—never `.querySelector(".some-class")`.

```tsx
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import userEvent from "@testing-library/user-event";
import { LoginForm } from "./LoginForm";

test("submits email and password", async () => {
  render(<LoginForm />);
  await userEvent.type(
    screen.getByRole("textbox", { name: /email/i }),
    "a@b.com"
  );
  await userEvent.type(screen.getByLabelText(/password/i), "secret");
  await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole("button", { name: /sign in/i }));
  expect(await screen.findByText(/welcome/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

**Common async tips:**

- Use `findBy...` for things that appear after async work.
- Wrap “event then UI change” expectations in `await screen.findBy...` or `await waitFor(...)`.
- Prefer **MSW** to mock HTTP so your component code doesn’t need stubs.

**Custom hooks:** test with `renderHook` from Testing Library’s hooks utilities; treat them like small components.

---

## 6) Integration and E2E: confidence per minute

**Integration tests** run components together with real routing, data fetching mocked at the network boundary via MSW. Cheap and powerful.

**E2E tests** run the whole app in a browser. Keep these **few and focused**: sign-in, critical flows, and “does the app boot.”

Playwright example:

```ts
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

test("user can checkout", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("/");
  await page.getByRole("link", { name: /cart/i }).click();
  await page.getByRole("button", { name: /checkout/i }).click();
  await expect(page.getByText(/thank you/i)).toBeVisible();
});
```

**Make E2E stable:**

- Add **data via API** or seed the DB before the test; don’t click through ten screens to set up state.
- Use **test IDs sparingly**—prefer roles. Use IDs only when there’s no accessible hook.

---

## 7) Contracts and data shape: stop breakage at the seam

- **Schema-first:** define response/request shapes with **zod** or **OpenAPI**. Validate at runtime; infer TS types from the schema.
- **Consumer-driven contracts:** with **Pact**, write tests that describe what your front-end expects; the back-end verifies it can meet that contract.
- **MSW + schema:** in tests, generate mock responses from the same schema so your mocks never drift.

---

## 8) Non-functional excellence

**Accessibility (a11y):**

- Use `getByRole`, `getByLabelText`, and `name`—your tests become a11y checks by default.
- Add **jest-axe** to catch common violations.
- In E2E, run axe after key pages load.

**Visual regression:**

- For critical screens, keep a few Playwright screenshots. Review diffs in CI.
- If you use Storybook, Chromatic can snapshot every story across browsers.

**Performance:**

- Measure with Lighthouse or Playwright traces.
- In React, test that “expensive” components memoize correctly and that Suspense fallbacks appear quickly.

**Security:**

- Add simple tests to ensure untrusted HTML is sanitized and dangerous flows are blocked.
- Run dependency and config checks in CI.

---

## 9) Snapshots, mocking, and other sharp tools

- **Snapshots**: great for small, stable outputs (like a serializer), or for ASTs and data mappers. **Avoid** big component tree snapshots; they rot.
- **Mocking**: default to **MSW** at the network layer. Only stub modules when the collaborator is _truly_ slow or nondeterministic (like `crypto`, `Date`, or a UUID generator).
- **Fake timers**: use only when time is the behavior under test.

---

## 10) Coverage, mutation testing, and quality bars

- Use coverage to **find gaps**, not to chase 100%. Focus on **branches** and **statements** in critical paths.
- Add **mutation testing** with Stryker to detect “tests that pass too easily.” Start with a subset of files in CI.

---

## 11) CI, speed, and scale

- **Parallelize** unit and component tests; shard E2E suites across workers.
- **Cache** dependencies and Playwright browsers to cut minutes.
- **Quarantine** flaky tests with a tag, fix them soon, and fail the build on new flake introductions.
- **Artifacts**: save Playwright traces, videos, and screenshots on failure—your future self will thank you.

---

## 12) Patterns specific to React and TypeScript

- **Data fetching libraries:**
  - React Query: in tests, provide a **test QueryClient** with retries disabled; wrap your render with a provider.
  - SWR: set up a provider in tests and mock fetch with MSW.

- **State managers:**
  - Redux Toolkit: test reducers with plain unit tests; test slices via component interactions.
  - Zustand/Jotai: export store creators so tests can create isolated stores.

- **Routing:**
  - For React Router, use `MemoryRouter` with initial entries; assert on **screen** not history internals.
  - For Next.js app router, prefer integration tests that hit real routes in Playwright.

- **Types as guardrails:**
  - Turn on strictest TypeScript options (`strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, etc.).
  - Use `zod` or similar to validate inbound data at runtime, then `.infer` types to keep compile-time in sync.

---

## 13) A simple, sensible project layout

```
src/
  lib/           // logic and adapters; mostly unit tests
  components/    // components with close-by component tests
  features/      // vertical slices: each has ui + hooks + tests
  pages/         // routing entry points
tests/
  e2e/           // Playwright
  contracts/     // Pact or schema validations
```

Keep tests next to the code **unless** they’re cross-cutting (E2E, contracts).

---

## 14) Your day-to-day workflow

1. **Start with a failing test** for the behavior you want—unit or component, whichever is closer to the user story.
2. **Make it pass with the dumbest change**.
3. **Refactor** mercilessly; your tests guard you.
4. When a story touches I/O or routing, add **one integration test** through the slice.
5. For a new critical journey, add **one E2E**.
6. Before merging: run a11y checks, glance at coverage, and read the diff of any snapshots.

---

## 15) Red flags and quick fixes

- **Tests that change every refactor** → You’re asserting implementation details. Move up a level and assert visible behavior.
- **Sleeps and timeouts** → Replace with `findBy...` or `waitFor`.
- **Flaky E2E** → Seed state via API, wait for _conditions_ not _time_, and use robust role-based selectors.
- **Giant fixtures** → Build data with small factory functions so each test states only what’s relevant.
- **Slow suite** → Profile tests, run in parallel, turn off React Query retries in tests, and cache browsers.

## 16) A six-week roadmap you can actually follow

**Week 1 – Fundamentals**

- Set up Vitest or Jest, Testing Library, and MSW.
- Write 10 unit tests and 5 component tests on real code.
- Turn on strict TypeScript and fix warnings.

**Week 2 – Component mastery**

- Add user-event interactions, async `findBy...`, and custom hook tests.
- Introduce jest-axe and fix two a11y issues it finds.

**Week 3 – Integration**

- Wrap renders with providers (Router, QueryClient).
- Replace all ad-hoc fetch mocks with MSW handlers.
- Add one integration test per feature slice.

**Week 4 – E2E**

- Install Playwright. Write 3 critical flow tests.
- Add test data seeding and artifacts on failure.

**Week 5 – Contracts and quality**

- Introduce zod or OpenAPI-generated types. Validate one endpoint at runtime.
- Add mutation tests for a core utility.

**Week 6 – Polish and scale**

- Wire everything into CI with sharding and caching.
- Add a small visual regression on your most important screen.
- Document testing conventions in a short “testing.md”.

## 17) Tiny reference—rules you can say out loud

- “**If a user can’t do it, my test won’t do it.**”
- “**Mock the network, not my components.**”
- “**One integration test per feature slice.**”
- “**Few but mighty E2E tests.**”
- “**Types are tests I don’t have to run.**”
- “**Arrange, Act, Assert—and keep them obvious.**”

---

## 18) Want a starting point?

If you’d like, I can generate:

- A **starter testing setup** for React + TypeScript with Vitest, Testing Library, MSW, Playwright, jest-axe, and example tests.
- A **personalized week-by-week checklist** based on your project’s stack.
- Or I can walk you through converting an existing test to be cleaner and more resilient.

Tell me what stack you’re on right now—Vite or Next.js, which package manager, and whether you already use React Query or another data layer—and I’ll tailor the commands and config so you can start today with real code.
