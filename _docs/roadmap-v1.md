## Phase 2: AI Integration & Intelligence

**Goal:** Implement the privacy-preserving AI analysis flow to bring "smart" features online.

### Task 11: Setup AI Workflow Infrastructure (`setup-ai-infrastructure`)

- **Action:** Implement the hybrid workflow approach using n8n + OpenRouter for maximum iteration speed.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Deploy n8n (start with cloud version for simplicity)
  - Set up OpenRouter account and configure API access
  - Create authentication tokens for webhook security
  - Test basic webhook connectivity
- **Outcome:** Visual workflow platform ready for AI logic development.

### Task 11.5: Design & Build Curated Ingredient Database (`build-ingredient-db`)

- **Action:** Create the backend database (e.g., Supabase table, Vercel KV) to act as the source of truth for ingredient classifications.
- **Implementation:**
  - Define schema: `ingredientName`, `foodGroup`, `defaultZone`, `zoneModifiers`.
  - Populate with an initial set of common ingredients (e.g., 200+ items).
  - Create an interface or API for the n8n workflow to query this database.
- **Outcome:** A consistent, curated reference for core ingredient data that underpins the app's intelligence.

### Task 12: Build AI Analysis Workflow (`build-ai-workflow`)

- **Action:** Create the visual workflow in n8n that handles the two-stage ingredient processing pipeline.
- **Workflow Components:**
  - **Stage 1 (Identification):**
    - Webhook trigger for receiving image data or manual ingredient list.
    - Multimodal AI call for image-to-text ingredient identification.
  - **Stage 2 (Enrichment):**
    - Database lookup node to query the **Curated Ingredient Database**.
    - Conditional logic: if ingredient is found, use curated data.
    - If not found, use a second AI call (fallback) to classify `foodGroup` and `zone`.
    - Implement a "learning loop" by logging AI-classified ingredients for future review and addition to the curated database.
  - **Output & Error Handling:**
    - Data transformation nodes for final JSON formatting.
    - Error handling and validation nodes.
- **Outcome:** A robust AI analysis workflow that combines the consistency of a curated database with the scalability of AI, capable of turning a photo or text into structured, intelligent data.

### Task 13: Create Simple API Route (`create-api-route`)

- **Action:** Build a lightweight Next.js API route that forwards requests to the n8n workflow.
- **Security Implementation:**
  - Implement rate limiting using `@upstash/ratelimit`
  - Add input validation and sanitization
  - Secure webhook authentication with tokens
  - Implement proper error handling and timeouts
  - **Structural Alignments:**
    - Create `app/api/` folder structure with proper route organization
    - Add `app/api/analyze/route.ts` for AI analysis endpoint
    - Add `app/api/auth/route.ts` for authentication API (if needed)
    - Enhance `lib/api/` with client utilities and endpoint definitions
    - Add API-specific validation schemas to `lib/validations/`
- **Outcome:** Secure API endpoint infrastructure that acts as a bridge between client and AI workflow.

### Task 14: Integrate Camera with Workflow (`integrate-camera`)

- **Action:** Connect the UI to the AI workflow, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.
- **Implementation:**
  - The _parent component_ that invokes `<CameraCapture>` will be responsible for handling the API call to `/api/analyze`.
  - The `<CameraCapture>` component itself remains agnostic, only returning an image string via a callback.
  - This preserves the reusability of the camera component as per the PRD.
  - Handle workflow response timing (may be slower than direct API calls) with proper loading states and error handling in the parent component.
- **Outcome:** Photos taken in the app are sent through the AI workflow for processing, while maintaining a clean component architecture.

### Task 15: Handle AI Analysis in UI (`update-ui-for-ai`)

- **Action:** Implement UI states to handle "Analyzing..." placeholders and display the structured data returned by the AI workflow.
- **Implementation:**
  - Add loading states for workflow processing.
  - Design and implement UI states for all three food statuses:
    - `analyzing`: Show a loading indicator or placeholder.
    - `pending_review`: Allow the user to view AI results and require confirmation before saving.
    - `processed`: Display the final, confirmed data.
  - Handle workflow timeouts and errors gracefully.
  - Implement retry logic for failed analyses.
- **Outcome:** A seamless user experience from capture to categorized data entry with proper error handling and a complete status lifecycle.

### Task 16: Build Insights Page (`build-insights-page`)

- **Action:** Create the "Insights & Analytics" page that performs all calculations and visualizations on the client-side using data from IndexedDB.

  - **Structural Alignments:**
    - Create `features/analytics/` folder with complete feature structure
    - Add `features/analytics/components/` for trend charts, correlation matrices, health score cards
    - Add `features/analytics/hooks/` for trend analysis and correlation calculations
    - Add `features/analytics/types/` for analytics-specific TypeScript types
    - Implement the actual `app/(protected)/app/insights/page.tsx` with full functionality
- **Outcome:** Users can see trends and correlations in their health data without it ever leaving their device, supported by a complete analytics feature architecture.

## AI Architecture Migration Path

As the application matures, there's an optional migration path for the AI architecture:

### **Phase 1: n8n + OpenRouter (Recommended Start)**

- **Benefits:** Maximum iteration speed, model flexibility, visual development
- **Trade-offs:** Additional service dependency, slightly higher latency
- **When to use:** During development and early user testing

### **Phase 2: Hybrid Architecture (Recommended for v1.0)**

- **Benefits:** Combines visual workflows with direct API calls for optimization
- **Implementation:** Use n8n for complex workflows, direct APIs for simple tasks
- **When to use:** When you have established workflows but need performance optimization

### **Phase 3: Direct API Integration (Optional Optimization)**

- **Benefits:** Lower latency, fewer dependencies, potentially lower costs
- **Trade-offs:** Reduced iteration speed, more complex code changes
- **When to migrate:** When AI logic is proven and stable, performance becomes critical

### **Decision Criteria for Migration:**

- **Performance:** If workflow latency becomes unacceptable (>5-10 seconds)
- **Cost:** If n8n + OpenRouter costs exceed direct API costs significantly
- **Complexity:** If visual workflow becomes harder to manage than code
- **Scale:** If request volume requires more optimized architecture
