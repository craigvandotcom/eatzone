### **Instructions for Food & Ingredient Zoning**

**Objective:** To accurately classify any given food or ingredient into one of three zonesâ€”ðŸ”´ RED, ðŸŸ¡ YELLOW, or ðŸŸ¢ GREENâ€”based on the principles of the Body Compass Spectrum Eating Plan.

**Core Philosophy:** This system is not about rigid "good" or "bad" labels. It's a spectrum that helps identify foods that are universally healing (Green), foods that require individual testing due to potential reactivity (Yellow), and foods that are commonly inflammatory and best avoided (Red). Your primary goal is to use this framework to determine a food's likely impact on the body.

### **The 4-Step Zoning Process**

Follow these steps in order to classify any food item.

**Step 1: Check for a Direct Match**
First, check the detailed lists in the Zone Reference Guide below to see if the food is explicitly mentioned. This is the fastest and most accurate method.

*   **Example:** If the food is "Spinach," you will find it under "All Vegetables" in the Green Zone.

**Step 2: Identify the Food's Primary Category**
If the food is not listed by name, identify its main category. Is it a meat, a vegetable, a fat, a sweetener, a grain, or a processed product?

*   **Example:** If the food is "Lamb," you identify it as a "Meat."

**Step 3: Analyze Quality, Source, and Processing**
This is the most critical step for deduction. The quality of the food is paramount. Look for keywords that describe its source and how it was produced. Use the **Good-Better-Best Hierarchy** table for guidance.

*   **High-Quality Descriptors (Lean toward ðŸŸ¢ GREEN):** `Grass-fed`, `Wild-caught`, `Pasture-raised`, `Organic`, `Extra virgin`, `Unprocessed`, `Local`, `Seasonal`.
*   **Caution Descriptors (Lean toward ðŸŸ¡ YELLOW):** `Gluten-free`, `Raw`, `Natural` (for sugars), `Soaked`.
*   **Low-Quality Descriptors (Lean toward ðŸ”´ RED):** `Conventional`, `Processed`, `Packaged`, `Refined`, `Factory-farmed`, `Artificial`, `Industrial`, `Enriched`.

*   **Example:** "Wild Salmon" is not listed, but "Salmon" falls under "Quality Meats." The descriptor "Wild" indicates the highest quality, placing it firmly in the **ðŸŸ¢ GREEN ZONE**. "Conventional Beef" falls under "Meat," but "Conventional" is a low-quality descriptor, placing it in the **ðŸ”´ RED ZONE**.

**Step 4: Assign the Zone**
Based on the category and quality analysis, make a final decision. If a product contains multiple ingredients from different zones, the most restrictive zone usually determines the final classification.

*   **Example:** "Store-bought mayonnaise" is a processed product. Its primary ingredients are typically **Industrial Seed Oils (ðŸ”´ RED)** and **Conventional Eggs (ðŸ”´ RED)**. Therefore, the entire product is classified as **ðŸ”´ RED ZONE**.

### **Zone Reference Guide**

Use these detailed lists for your analysis.

### ðŸ”´ **RED ZONE - AVOID**
**Principle:** Foods that commonly cause inflammation, gut issues, and reactivity. These should be avoided entirely during the initial elimination phase.

| Category | Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Processed/Packaged Foods** | Chips, cookies, crackers, most breakfast cereals, soda, pre-made meals. |
| **Refined Sugars & Grains** | Table sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, white bread, white pasta, pastries. |
| **Industrial Seed Oils** | Canola, soybean, sunflower, corn, safflower, grapeseed, vegetable oil. |
| **Gluten & Most Grains** | Wheat, rye, barley, spelt, and products made from them. |
| **Conventional Animal Products** | Meat, poultry, and dairy from factory-farmed animals. |
| **Artificial Sweeteners**| Aspartame, sucralose, saccharin, acesulfame K. |
| **Non-Organic Alcohol** | Beer, sweet cocktails, most spirits and wines. |

---

### ðŸŸ¡ **YELLOW ZONE - TEST**
**Principle:** Potentially problematic foods that require careful, individual testing after an elimination period to see how your body responds.

| Category | Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Gluten-Free Grains** | White rice, rolled oats, corn, quinoa, buckwheat. |
| **Legumes**| Black beans, lentils, chickpeas, soy, peanuts. |
| **Nuts & Seeds** | Almonds, walnuts, cashews, chia, flax seeds. |
| **Pasture-Raised Eggs** | Whole eggs from chickens that are free to roam and eat a natural diet. |
| **Nightshades** | Tomatoes, white potatoes, bell peppers, eggplant, cayenne. |
| **High-Quality Dairy** | Grass-fed ghee, raw cheese, A2 milk, goat/sheep milk. |
| **Shellfish** | Shrimp, crab, lobster, mussels. |
| **Natural Sugars (in moderation)** | Raw honey, maple syrup, date syrup, coconut sugar. |
| **Clean Alcohol (in strict moderation)** | Tequila, Mezcal, Dry Red Wine, Dry Cider. |
| **Higher-Sugar & Other Fruits**| Bananas, mangos, grapes, apples, oranges. |
| **Seed-based Spices**| Cumin, coriander, mustard seed, fennel. |

### ðŸŸ¢ **GREEN ZONE - ENJOY**
**Principle:** Healing, nutrient-dense foods that promote vitality and are well-tolerated by most people.

| Category | Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quality Meats**| Grass-fed beef, wild salmon, pasture-raised chicken, lamb, venison. |
| **Healthy Fats & Oils** | Avocado & avocado oil, extra virgin olive oil, coconut oil, ghee, tallow. |
| **All Vegetables** | **Especially leafy greens:** spinach, kale, chard, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini. |
| **Low-Sugar Fruits** | Blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, blackberries. |
| **Fermented Foods** | Sauerkraut, kimchi, pickles, water kefir, unsweetened kombucha. |
| **Natural Sweeteners** | Stevia, monk fruit. |

### **Good-Better-Best Hierarchy (Key Decision Tool)**

Use this table to resolve ambiguity. If a food falls into a category, its quality determines its place on the spectrum.

| Category | BEST (ðŸŸ¢) | BETTER (ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡) | GOOD (ðŸŸ¡) | MAYBE (ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´) | BAD (ðŸ”´) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Oils** | Ghee, Tallow, Coconut Oil | Olive Oil (low heat) | Avocado Oil | High-Oleic Sunflower | Industrial Seed Oils |
| **Sweeteners**| Stevia / None | Monk Fruit | Maple Syrup (rarely) | Raw Honey | HFCS, Artificial |
| **Grains** | Grain-Free | Soaked White Rice | GF Oats (if tolerated) | Soaked Brown Rice | Refined White Flour |
| **Plant Produce** | Local, Organic, Seasonal | Organic | Sprayed, Out of Season | Conventional (Dirty Dozen) | GMO |
| **Animal Products** | Grass-fed / Wild | Organic / Free-Range | Conventional | Conventional, Lean | Factory-Farmed |
| **Alcohols** | None | Tequila, Mezcal (Rarely) | Dry Red Wine | Dry Cider, Spirits | Beer, Sweet Cocktails |

### **Practical Zoning Examples**

*   **Food: "Organic Ghee"**
    1.  **Direct Match:** Ghee is listed in both Yellow (High-Quality Dairy) and Green (Healthy Fats) zones.
    2.  **Category:** It's a Healthy Fat/Dairy.
    3.  **Quality:** The "Good-Better-Best" chart lists Ghee under "BEST" for Oils. The term "Organic" reinforces its high quality.
    4.  **Decision:** **ðŸŸ¢ GREEN ZONE**.

*   **Food: "Canned Chickpeas"**
    1.  **Direct Match:** Chickpeas are listed under "Legumes."
    2.  **Category:** Legumes.
    3.  **Quality:** Legumes as a category fall into the test zone. Being canned is a form of processing.
    4.  **Decision:** **ðŸŸ¡ YELLOW ZONE**.

*   **Food: "Salad dressing with soybean oil"**
    1.  **Direct Match:** Not listed.
    2.  **Category:** A processed product (dressing). The primary ingredient is an oil.
    3.  **Quality:** Soybean oil is explicitly listed as an "Industrial Seed Oil."
    4.  **Decision:** **ðŸ”´ RED ZONE**.

*   **Food: "Pasture-raised pork"**
    1.  **Direct Match:** Not listed.
    2.  **Category:** Meat.
    3.  **Quality:** "Pasture-raised" is a high-quality descriptor, equivalent to "Grass-fed" or "Wild." This puts it in the "BEST" category for Animal Products.
    4.  **Decision:** **ðŸŸ¢ GREEN ZONE**.
